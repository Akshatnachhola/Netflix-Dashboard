# Netflix-Dashboard
The well-known streaming provider Netflix has a vast selection of films, TV programs, and original programming. The original dataset, which can be accessed here, has been cleaned up and made available in this dataset. The information consists of materials that Netflix added between 2008 and 2021. The earliest content dates back to 1925, and the most recent is from 2021.This dataset was created to evaluate my data visualization abilities.
Finding the important insights I wanted to emphasize was the first step in designing an effective dashboard. After careful consideration, I made the decision to concentrate on three key areas: the top 10 genres throughout years, distribution trends over time for movies by region, and rating
I created an area chart to depict the increase of Netflix's movie additions over time in order to illustrate the movie distribution trends. I was able to picture how the platform changed and grew its movie catalog as a result. After that, I created a bar chart to display the top 10 movie genres within the years under and a circle chart to compare the distribution of movies and TV series in percentage to the total number of movies and TV shows.
The development of this dashboard revealed a number of significant insights and findings. From 2008 to 2021, I discovered that Netflix's movie library grew exponentially, demonstrating the company's commitment to growing its content library. I also noticed that the majority of the films were rated TV-MA (Mature Audience). Finally, it was clear from my visualization that from 2008 to 2021, the number of documentaries uploaded to Netflix significantly increased.
It was a thrilling experience to use Tableau to create a dashboard to examine how movies were distributed on Netflix from 2008 until 2020. I was able to identify patterns and trends that provided insight into Netflix's historical movie acquisition strategy through the process of turning raw data into insightful visuals. I was able to show my findings in a dynamic and interesting way by combining the strength of Tableau with the plethora of instructional resources on YouTube.
Dashboard can be interected with on Tbaleau.
